# How To Make Good Shapes for each Assay

- alpha shapes on the points
    - done by arena or all together
    - doesn't work great because it's too hard to make the "correct" shape
- manual shape making
    - define circle, rectangle, y-maze shape and fit
    - manual labor to make good shapes
        - maybe have to make a different rectangle for each rectangular plate
    - zantiks asset generation may help, but would require work to port
- use the zantiks bitmaps
    - some are good, but y-maze 15 sucks - not the right shape
- something smarter with defining a number of sides? solving for the best fit?
    - was hoping an algorithm would already exist
    - ai not very helpful here
