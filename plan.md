# How Will This Work?

## Goals

- usable once i'm gone
- possibly extendable once i'm gone
    - new assays
- understandable, not a black box
    - explanations shouldn't be forced
    - documentation should exist and be relatively easy to find
- relatively simple, cannot take forever to develop
    - could ask cammie if that is something she wants

## Ideal Workflow

1. download the experiment folder from box
2. open gui and point to that folder
    - possibly point to genotypes file as well?
3. select assay type
4. select wells for each assay?
5. get csv file that can be imported into prism for analysis
